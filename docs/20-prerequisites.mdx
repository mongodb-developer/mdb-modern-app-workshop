# üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites 

Before we dive into building with MongoDB, let's set up our environment and get our starter project running.

## 1. Development Environment

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm (v6 or later)
- Git

## 2. MongoDB Atlas Setup

We'll be using MongoDB Atlas, a fully-managed cloud database service. Let's set up a free cluster:

1. Go to [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) and sign up for a free account if you don't have one.
2. Create a new project named "EventBuddy".
3. Click "Build a Database" and choose the free shared cluster option.
4. Select your preferred cloud provider and region.
5. Click "Create Cluster" (this may take a few minutes to provision).

Once your cluster is created:

6. In the Security menu, create a database user with read and write privileges.
7. In the Network Access menu, add your current IP address to the IP whitelist.
8. Go to the Clusters view, click "Connect", choose "Connect your application", and copy the connection string. We'll use this later.

## 3. Setting Up the Stub Application

We'll start with a stub application and gradually add MongoDB functionality. Let's get it set up:

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/mongodb-developer/eventer-sample-project.git
cd eventer-sample-project
```
- OR -
Use github codespaces to open the project in a browser-based IDE.

2. Install dependencies for backend and frontend:
```bash
cd backend
```

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
cd ../frontend
```

```bash
npm install
```


3. Start the application:
```bash
cd backend
```

```bash
npm start
```

```bash
cd ../frontend
```

```bash
npm start
```



You should see the application running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). If you use the browser-based IDE, it will popup a toast to open the url.

## 4. MongoDB Compass (Optional but Recommended)

MongoDB Compass is a powerful GUI for MongoDB that can be helpful during development:

1. Visit the [MongoDB Compass page](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass)
2. Download and install MongoDB Compass
3. You can use the same connection string from Atlas to connect Compass to your cluster

With these steps completed, you're all set to start building with MongoDB!

## Next Steps

In the following sections, we'll guide you through connecting your application to MongoDB Atlas and implementing various features using MongoDB's powerful capabilities. Get ready to transform this stub application into a fully-functional event management system backed by MongoDB!
