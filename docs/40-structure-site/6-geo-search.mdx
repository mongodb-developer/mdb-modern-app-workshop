# üåç Running geospatial queries with MongoDB

In this section, we'll explore how to use geospatial queries in MongoDB to enable location-based search in our Eventer application. MongoDB provides powerful geospatial features that allow us to store and query location data efficiently.

As you may noticed the location dropdown values are associated with coordinates. We will use these coordinates to perform geospatial queries to find events near a specific location.

## What are Geospatial Queries?

Geospatial queries in MongoDB allow us to store and query location data using the GeoJSON format. MongoDB supports two types of geospatial queries:

1. **Near Queries**: Find documents near a specific location.
2. **GeoWithin Queries**: Find documents within a specific area.

We'll focus on the `near` query to find events near a given location.


## Create a Geospatial Index

Before we can perform geospatial queries, we need to create a geospatial index on our MongoDB collection. This index allows MongoDB to efficiently query location data.

### Step 1: Create a Geospatial Index

We'll create a 2dsphere index on the `location.address` field of our `events` collection. This index will enable us to perform near queries on the location data.

```javascript
// backend/server.ts

// Create a 2dsphere index on the location field
async function initializeMongoDB() {
  try {
    db = await connectToMongoDB.connect();
    console.log('MongoDB connected successfully');
    await db.collection('events').createIndex({ 'location.address': '2dsphere' });
    console.log('Created 2dsphere index on location.address');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to connect to MongoDB', error);
    process.exit(1);
  }
}

```


### Step 2: Use the geoNear Operator

Now that we have created the geospatial index, we can use the `$geoNear` operator in the aggregation pipeline to perform a near query.


TODO: Implement a route `app.get('/api/location/search')` to find events near a specific location in `backend/server.ts`.

Docs: [$geoNear](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/geoNear/)

<summary>Hint</summary>

Use the `$geoNear` stage in the aggregation pipeline to perform a near query on the indexed field. You can specify the `near` parameter with the coordinates of the location you want to search near. Remeber that the coordinates should be in the GeoJSON format which is under `query.address`.

```javascript
// backend/server.ts

app.get('/api/search/location', async (req, res) => {
  const locQuery: any = req.query.query
  const query = JSON.parse(locQuery);


  try {
      const results = await db.collection('events').aggregate([
          {
              $geoNear: {
                  near: query.address,
                  distanceField: 'distance',
                  spherical: true
              }
          }
      ]).toArray();

      res.json(results);
  } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error searching for events:', error);
      res.status(500).json({ error: 'Error searching for events' });
  }
});
```

</details>


## Test the Geospatial Query

Now that we have implemented the geospatial query, let's test it by searching for events near a specific location.

Great! You have successfully implemented geospatial queries in your Eventer application. Users can now search for events near a specific location using the coordinates associated with the event locations.
