# ðŸ‘† Indexing

In this section, we'll explore how to create indexes in MongoDB for optimizing query performance. Indexes are data structures that store a small portion of the collection's data set in an easy-to-traverse form. By creating indexes on fields that are frequently queried, you can speed up read operations and improve the overall performance of your application.

## What are Indexes?

Indexes in MongoDB are similar to indexes in relational databases. They store a sorted representation of the data in a collection based on the values of one or more fields. When you query a collection, MongoDB can use indexes to quickly locate the documents that match the query criteria.

## Creating Indexes

To create an index in MongoDB, you use the `createIndex` method on a collection. You can create indexes on single fields, compound indexes on multiple fields, and text indexes for full-text search.


### Step 1: Create a Single Field Index


We'll create a single-field index on the field date. This way we can quickly query events based on their date.

```javascript
// backend/server.js

// Create a 2dsphere index on the location field
async function connect()
{
    db = await connectToMongoDB();
    await db.collection('events').createIndex({ 'location.address': '2dsphere' });
    await db.collection('events').createIndex({ date: -1 });
}

```

This code creates a descending index on the date field. The `-1` value specifies that the index should be sorted in descending order.

### Step 2 : Add order to events based on dates 

Now that we have created the index, we can use it to sort events based on their date.

TODO: Use the created index to sort events based on their date in `backend/server.js`.

You can use the `sort` method on the MongoDB collection to sort the events based on the date field. Remember to pass the field name and the sort order (1 for ascending, -1 for descending).

```javascript
// backend/server.js

app.get('/api/events', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const events = await db.collection('events').find().sort({ date: -1 }).toArray();
        res.json(events);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error fetching events:', error);
        res.status(500).json({ error: 'Error fetching events' });
    }
});
```

</details>

Great! Now you have created an index on the date field and used it to sort events based on their date.

You have finished the mandatory part of the workshop! Feel free to explore the optional sections to learn more about MongoDB and AI.
