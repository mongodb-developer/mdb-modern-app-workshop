# ðŸ¤– Chainlit Co-Pilot bot

Chainlit is an open source Bot framework. It allows building costomizable AI conversational elements. 

In our case we will use its server and co-pilot emebdded feature to add a conversational chatbot based on our data.

## Setup Chainlit

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11  or higher
- The pip package manager
- Open AI API KEY

## Setup OPEN AI key
You will need to set up your OpenAI key to use the encoder. You can do this by setting the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable.

If no key provided for you by the workshop, you can get your key from the OpenAI website:
1. Go to the [OpenAI website](https://platform.openai.com/)
2. Sign up for an account
3. Create a new API key > Copy the key

You can set the key in your terminal.

### Installation


1. Install the required packages:
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r chainlit/requirements.txt
```

2. Setup OPEN AI key in `.env` file:
```bash
MONGODB_ATLAS_URI=your_mongodb_uri
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
```



3. Start the server in a new terminal:
```bash
chainlit run chainlit/server.py
```

Once the server loads you will see a chat interface in your browser. You can test it reponds in any way. 

Although the bot is not trained yet, it will not be able to provide valubale information.
